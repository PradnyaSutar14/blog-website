                <h2>Discover the real 5G.</h2>
                <h3>Patrick Lopez <br> December 22, 2021</h3>

                <p class="para">
                    One of the main promises of 5G is the capacity to create different connectivity services for different devices, people, geographies, industries… Until now, the networks were essentially delivering the same connectivity to everyone, at the same speed,
                    on a best-effort basis. With 5G, networks will be able to create slices. They are specific connectivity products which have deterministic capabilities in terms of speed, latency, coverage, etc. This will enable tomorrow’s networks
                    to facilitate services as diverse as augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, robotics and new media wherever you are, at home, at work, at school, indoors or outside.

                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>1. Cloud-native </h2>
                    Our 5G core architecture is represented as a service-based architecture (SBA) which is a common compute platform. Network functions like NEF, NRF, PCF, UDM, AF, AUSF, AMF, SMF are designed as containerized cloud-native microservices thereby enabling quick
                    creation of scalable and resilient networks. All these NFs communicate with each other using Service Based Interfaces (SBI).

                    <br>In 4G, the communication between network elements was based on a Binary-based protocols where bandwidth usage was a major concern. With the cloud-native approach of hosting core network functions, the focus is to leverage the huge
                    ecosystem of cloud infrastructure and developers. In 5G, a majority of those earlier generation protocols are replaced with standard web protocols so that 5G Core network can be easily integrated with cloud networks.</p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2> 2. Stateless Network Functions</h2>
                    Our 5G core is designed with stateless NFs where we decouple the computing from the storage functions which makes for much more efficient communications between nodes. This design allows control to run on a compute resource and an external database is
                    used to store stateful persistent data. It ensures enhanced reliability and fast failure recovery by maintaining redundancy of storage nodes and independent scalability of NFs.<br>
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>3. Open Networks</h2>
                    So far telecom networks have been closed systems providing a very limited 3rd party access. In 5GC, the SCEF part of 4G has been taken to a whole new level with Network Exposure Function (NEF).

                    <br>With a move to complete cloud-native environment and breaking vendors lock-in, the large traditional packet core monolithic applications are now broken down into independent microservices and open APIs are used to access these
                    services. Open APIs drive CSPs to explore new business opportunities since the NEF exposes the network capabilities over APIs to external network entities and execute or influence operations, in the network domain in a secure and controlled
                    way.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2> 4. Slicing</h2>
                    The cloud-native core network architecture allows the network to be partitioned in such a way that the same telecommunications cloud infrastructure can implement multiple customized logical networks (slices). This can support the functionalities optimized
                    for specific use cases like “enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB),” “ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC)” and “massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC)”. And it meets the diverse industry requirements through SLAs defined
                    for a particular industry, be it a consumer market or an enterprise.

                    <br> The CSPs can benefit from quick monetization since diversified services can run on the same infrastructure.</p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>5. Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC)</h2>
                    Multi access Edge Computing (MEC) is yet another distinguishing feature of 5G core that enables the deployment of low latency applications. The latency reduction is made possible with CUPS architecture which supports the distributed deployment of UPF.
                    It is possible to install applications on edge data centers that are closer to users and hence, supporting innovative use cases like AR/VR, control of automated driving, smart factories etc.
