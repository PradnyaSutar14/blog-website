                <h2>Beyond 5G: The new era of connectivity.</h2>
                <h3>Ken Nagai <br> July 7, 2023</h3>

                <p class="para">
                    At NEC, we look forward to the beginning of a new era of connectivity which we call ‘new windowBeyond 5G’. NEC defines Beyond 5G as a communications system that integrates networks with distributed data processing, organically utilizing computation resources
                    distributed worldwide and implementing real-time interaction across the globe. Beyond 5G technology will shape a new society — which will remove all physical barriers to communication and unlock the full reach of human potential even
                    beyond it. The technical evolution of Beyond 5G will be of much greater scale than an isolated step in the development of wireless communication technology: Beyond 5G will develop through a process of merging the latest network solutions
                    with complementary technologies such as distributed computing and AI. This revolution in technical capability will have wide-ranging effects, from transforming individual lives to the wider scale of reshaping businesses and society.</p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>Beyond 5G: What the future holds for society</h2>
                    With our progress towards a Beyond 5G future, physical barriers of space and time will be progressively withdrawn, which will, in turn, remove social barriers and empower a fully inclusive society to thrive without limitation. New experiences are waiting
                    to be discovered: a seamlessly integrated blend of real and virtual worlds will enable every individual to reach their potential without physical or temporal limitations. With a seamless universal network coverage — opportunities will
                    flourish for people in all parts of the world to shape their lives according to their values. This will extend into diversifying choice of workstyles — we will see greater freedom and a wider range of choices for how people choose
                    to work than are currently available.</p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>The role of AI in data analytics and processing</h2>
                    The volume of data processing required to achieve this vision of a fully integrated society will require an innovative unification of different technologies: AI and globally distributed computing powers will be integrated to create a dynamic network that
                    can carry the enormous and constant flow of data with real-time processing. The sum of these combined technologies is what defines ‘Beyond’ 5G at a technical level. This will be the foundation needed to achieve communication performance
                    with high speed, high capacity, and low latency. The relationship between networks and AI will emerge through a co-evolutionary process; At NEC, we are already working along the lines of a bidirectional and organic development between
                    ‘AI for Networks’ and ‘Networks for AI’. AI technologies must be able to sustain fully automated processing, and this will require AI that can adapt and evolve in response to changes in the environment in order to maintain real-time
                    processing on a global scale.</p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>Three types of communications</h2>
                    The Beyond 5G revolution will be supported by three types of communications: hyper-realistic communication, digital twins, and ubiquitous global coverage. To achieve the first of these, new forms of data must be incorporated: spatial information, the
                    five human senses, along with wider contextual information about the motivations of our interactions. As for digital twins, these are a means to extract data from the real world and reproduce it in a virtual world. Lastly, seamless
                    coverage across all locations on Earth will be attained by a range of technologies to eliminate remaining dead zones such as millimeter waves, terahertz waves, geostationary orbit satellites (GEO), low earth orbit (LEO) satellites,
                    and high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). </p>
