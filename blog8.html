                    In wireless communication, Fifth Generation (5G) Technology is a recent generation of mobile networks. In this paper, evaluations in the field of mobile communication technology are presented. In each evolution, multiple challenges were faced that were
                    captured with the help of next-generation mobile networks. Among all the previously existing mobile networks, 5G provides a high-speed internet facility, anytime, anywhere, for everyone. 5G is slightly different due to its novel features
                    such as interconnecting people, controlling devices, objects, and machines. 5G mobile system will bring diverse levels of performance and capability, which will serve as new user experiences and connect new enterprises. Therefore,
                    it is essential to know where the enterprise can utilize the benefits of 5G. In this research article, it was observed that extensive research and analysis unfolds different aspects, namely, millimeter wave (mmWave), massive multiple-input
                    and multiple-output (Massive-MIMO), small cell, mobile edge computing (MEC), beamforming, different antenna technology, etc. This article’s main aim is to highlight some of the most recent enhancements made towards the 5G mobile system
                    and discuss its future research objectives.</p>

                    <h2>Role of 5G Networks</h2>
                    Dive deep into your imagination and seek a world where smart homes can unlock doors just by scanning your face, automatically adjust lighting and temperature, a world where chronic diseases are managed 24-7 and where accidents are a thing of the past.
                    You can imagine that the fifth generation of wireless technology promises more than just a fast network. It will not only help you redefine the network but also establish a new global wireless standard for speed. A 5G network builds
                    a bridge to the future. This technology is not just a new generation of wireless technology, it is a 5G foundation to release the full potential of IoT thus revolutionizing technological growth.

                    <h2>What Are the Advantages Of 5G And Use Cases?</h2>
                    <b>1. Greater speed in transmissions</b><br><br> Speed in transmissions can reach 15 to 20 Gbps. With the help of the newfound speed we can access data, files, programs etc on remote applications.<br><br>
                    <b>2. Increased number of devices connected</b><br><br> 5G impact on IoT is clearly the increased number of devices that can be connected to the network. All connected devices are able to communicate with each other in real-time and
                    exchange information to drive different outcomes based on type of data.<br><br>
                    <b>3. Lower latency</b><br><br> In simple words, latency is the time that passes between the order given to your smart device till the action occurs. Thanks to 5G this time will be ten times less than what it was in 4G. For example:
                    Due to lower latency the use of sensors can be increased in industrial plants. Be it control of machinery, control over logistics or remote transport all is now possible.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>4. Network slicing </b><br><br> 5G implements virtual networks and creates subnets such that the network connection is adjusted as per the specific requirements. By creating subnetworks, some specific characteristics are given to
                    a part of the network. The programmable network will prioritize connections, in case of emergencies by allocating different latencies in the connection. You are now familiar with the advancements and advantages that applications of
                    IoT in 5G can offer. So, let’s discuss how this wave of new technology is coming up with an endless number of use cases.<br>
