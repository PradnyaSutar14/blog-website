                    5G is the fifth-generation cellular network technology that allows users to gain more advantages. It is replacing 4G networks slowly in different parts of the world that caters to the needs of smartphone users when they want to access the data. The network
                    not only benefits individuals but also developers to deploy applications faster. On the other hand, it is important to know the pros and cons of 5G technology in detail that will help make the right decision. </p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>Pros of 5G: </h2>
                    <b>1. High speeds </b>
                    <br>5G works faster on mobile phones and other devices when compared to 4G and 4G LTE. It allows users to download movies, videos, and music in seconds as opposed to minutes. The network has 20 Gbps speed enabling organizations to
                    use the same for services such as automation, advanced web conferencing, etc. A recent survey says that consumers who used 5G saved nearly 23 hours per day in the downloading process.
                    <br><b>2. Low latency </b>
                    <br>5G has low latency when compared to 4G that will support new applications such as AI, IoT, and virtual reality efficiently. Not only that, it enables mobile phone users to open a webpage and browse things without any hassles. Another
                    thing is that it gives ways to access the internet anytime when looking for some important information
                    <br><b>3. Increased capacity  </b>
                    <br>5G has the capacity to deliver up to 100 times more capacity than 4G. It allows companies to switch between cellular and Wi-Fi wireless strategies that will help a lot to experience better performance. Apart from that, it provides
                    methods to access the internet with high efficiency.
                    <br><b>4. More bandwidth </b>
                    <br>One of the main advantages of 5G is that it increases more bandwidth that will help transfer the data as soon as possible. Furthermore, mobile phone users can ensure a faster connection with more bandwidth after choosing a 5G network.
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                    <h2>Cons of 5G :</h2>
                    <b>1. Limited global coverage</b>
                    <br>The main disadvantage of 5G is that it has limited global coverage and is available only in specific locations. Only cities can benefit a lot from 5G network and remote areas may not get the coverage it for some years. Moreover,
                    the expenses for setting tower stations are high when compared to other networks.
                    <br><b>2. Decreased broadcast distance  </b>
                    <br>Although 5G works fast at high speed, it wonâ€™t travel as far when compared to 4G. Moreover, tall buildings and trees may block the frequency of the 5G network that will result in various problems. Therefore, it requires more towers
                    for coverage that is time-consuming and expensive. Rain can also cause problems to 5G coverage that needs more protection.
                    <br><b>3. Upload speeds  </b>
                    <br>5G technologies allow mobile phone users to ensure high download speeds. On the other hand, the upload speeds are not over 100 Mbps when compared to 4G. Furthermore, mobile phones need better battery technology while using a 5G
                    connection. Many phone users say that they experience more heat on their devices while running 5G.
                    <br><b>4. Cybersecurity  </b>
                    <br>Cybersecurity is one of the drawbacks of 5G because it will result in hacking. The expansion in the bandwidth enables criminals to steal the database with ease. Moreover, it uses software that leads to vulnerable attacks. As 5G
                    connects with more devices, the chances of attacks are very high. Hence, companies and businesses should protect their infrastructure with a security operations center that will result in additional expenses.
